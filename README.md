# Amazon Sales EDA and Modeling
*A data analyst exploratory analysis and modeling project made with Amazon sales and rating data.*

## Overview
This project analyzes Amazon product pricing, sales, and ratings data, applying data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and modeling techniques to uncover trends and relationships in the dataset.

## Process Summary
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of an Amazon dataset to predict discounted prices for products. The process began with data preprocessing and cleaning, where I handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical features. Next, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover important patterns and relationships in the data. Finally, I built a regression model to predict discounted prices, evaluating the model's performance through metrics like R² and Mean Squared Error. Each phase of the project aimed to enhance the model’s accuracy and interpretability, and the results are showcased in the subsequent sections.

### Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
The dataset contained 1,456 rows of 16 columns. I determined that the following columns were important for my analysis:

- `category`: The department, sub-department, sub-sub-department, etc. that a product belonged to.
- `discounted_price`: The discounted price in Indian rupees of the product. I chose to interpret this as the final price the product sold for.
- `actual_price`: The actual price (before discounts) in Indian rupees of the product.
- `discount_percentage`: The percent of the actual price that was discounted, calculated as $ 100 \times \frac{\text{actual\_cost} - \text{discounted\_cost}}{\text{actual\_cost}} $
